# rock-paper-scissors

Hello! This is my rock paper scissors game that I will be working on for The Odin Project. The main goal of this game is to use what I've learned so far to create this game from scratch including: 

- How to break a larger problem into several small problems to manage easily. 
- Basic use of Javascript including arrays, picking a random option from an array, accepting user input, and comparing to the random option from the given array.
